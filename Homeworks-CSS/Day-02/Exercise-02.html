            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes it as “ultra-low temperature poaching.”</p>
            <p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef's table, contact us before November 30.</p>
